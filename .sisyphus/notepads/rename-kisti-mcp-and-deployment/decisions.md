# Decisions

Append-only notes: decisions made and rationale.

## Task 4 rollout policy defaults

- Decision: keep `uv run` workflow for contributors; promote `uvx kisti-mcp` for end users.
- Decision: staged distribution: Git-tag `uvx --from git+...@tag` first, PyPI second.
- Decision: keep `kisti-mcp-server` as compatibility alias for 2 minor releases.
