Task 4 Test Evidence

Commands
- uv run ruff check .
- uv run pytest -q

Result
- Ruff: All checks passed
- Pytest: 4 passed

Notes
- Tests load `kisti-mcp-server.py` via importlib spec to avoid renaming the hyphenated filename.
- Tests inject dummy env vars before module execution to satisfy import-time client validation.
- NTIS async HTTP is mocked via respx; no real network calls.
